As I am in my final year of Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo, we must complete a [Capstone Design Project](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/entrepreneurship/capstone-design) (otherwise know as a Fourth Year Design Project or FYDP).

>Capstone Design is the culmination of the undergraduate student experience, creating a blueprint for innovation in engineering design. - Waterloo Engineering

For my fourth year design project I am working on a very exciting project which involves building an energy storage system (ESS) using repurposed Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries. Stay tuned for more information about the project!
