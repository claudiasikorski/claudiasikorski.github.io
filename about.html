<h2 id="blog">About Blog</h2>

This blog serves as a repository for the original posts and cross posts of guest posts written by <a href="https://mrandrewandrade.com"target="_blank"> Andrew Andrade </a>.  It can include technical articles, study notes, general thoughts on a subject, lessons learned and anything else which I think is worthy to share!     

<p> Like my  <a href="http://mrandrewandrade.com"target="_blank">personal site</a> and  <a href="http://cv.mrandrewandrade.com"target="_blank">curricula vit&aelig;</a>, the this blog is hosted on Github Pages.  Originally I used uWaterloo's Computer Science Club to post my blog and portfolio using a custom Wordpress site.  Wordpress' interface, plug-ins and drag and drop set-up kept me using the site, but after being tired of the constant security updates and slow performance, I switched over to a simple static html page.  I knew I would eventually need a CMS, but I was happy with the simplictiy and performacen of a static landing page.

As I progressed to learning to mostly use the command line, using `git`, `Markdown`, `vim`, `tmux` and `zsh`, it became the natural decision to switch over to using Github pages for my webhosting needs.  Github pages enabled making changes to my site to be as simple as a `git commit` and made me very happy. Since Markdown is very simple and fast to use, it became a natural extension.

This platform I built for blogging has the same mainstream features which other blogs have: RSS feeds, search, tags, categories.  It is still a work in progress, but I am pretty happy with it currently!
