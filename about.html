<h2 id="blog">Meet Claudia Sikorski!</h2>

<p> I am currently a candidate in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/public-health-and-health-systems/future-undergraduates/programs/health-studies"target="_blank"> School of Public Health and Health Systems</a> in my third year. Since my teenage years, I have been a strong believer in the early prevention of illness, not merely the treatment of illness! My experience at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto with the <a href="http://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=occ-cancer-genetics"target="_blank">Cancer Genetics and High Risk Program</a> and my time at Hamilton General Hospital as a research assistant in the <a href="http://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/body.cfm?id=2401"target="_blank">Heart Investigation Unit</a>, has only strengthened this belief. 

To learn more about my past experiences, check out my <a href="http://claudiasikorski.github.io/cv.html"target="_blank">curricula vit&aelig;</a> on this site or <a href="includes/claudiasikorski-resume.pdf">Download</a> my resume directly.

<h2 id="blog">What will you find on this Blog?</h2>

<p> This blog serves as a collection of original posts on several topics relating to health and disease statistics, and basics on how to use R Programming language to analyze health data (I'm still learning) through examples. You'll also find a healthy mix of recipes, my trips in nature and any other random topics I feel like sharing! A work in progress that I hope you'll enjoy!
